# VSCode

VSCode's official guide should be the primary resource to follow. This article only points readers to the proper links and complements some caveats when necessary.

VSCode's user and workspace settings: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings

## Vim

Follow the official guide: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim

The press-and-hold mechanism on Mac is tricky (accents on letters). The guide for key-repeating may not work: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/729#issuecomment-245758863

For emulated plugins, I don't think any plugins are necessary. For example, NerdTree, used by almost all vim users, can be completely replaced with the navigation bar. The only emulated plugin I use is [vim-airline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim#vim-airline).

Problems with the emulated vim-airline:

- Color: see my settings.json (TODO: upload)
- Too small (TODO: how to solve?)
- Font is not fixed-space font (TODO: how to solve?)
