1. Shutdown your VM.
2. In VM settings, choose the virtual hard disk you are using for the VM and expand the size.
4. Create a snapshot AFTER changing your VM disk size. Old snapshots WILL NOT BE COMPATIBLE.
3. Boot your VM.
4. Open a terminal and
5. sudo fdisk -l
6. Look on the first line for something like /dev/sda or /dev/nvme. This is your disk name.
7. sudo fdisk <disk name>
8. n (for new partition)
9. Press enter to get the default values until it says "created a new partition of size x"
10. w (to write to disk)
11. sudo fdisk -l
12. Look for a new Device compared to step 5. the /dev/sdax or /dev/nvmex is your device name.
13. sudo mkfs.ext4 <device name>
14. sudo mkdir /mnt/files (or whatever you want to call your extra space)
14. sudo vim /etc/fstab
15. add this line to the bottom of your file
   <device name> <part 14 dir> ext4 defaults 0 1
   
   for example, mine says:
   /dev/sda4 /mnt/files ext4 defaults 0 1
   
reboot, and you will find your new space in /mnt/files. it's nice to create symlink
from your os directory to new directories in /mnt/files
